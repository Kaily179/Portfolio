## Project Title - Sentiment Analysis of Amazon products reviews

## Overview 
Electronic commerce experienced significant growth as a result of its resurgence over the internet and network technologies, resulting in a flow of customers into online shopping for major platforms like Amazon, Target, Walmart, etc. Positive and negative customer reviews greatly influence the choice a buyer makes before making an online purchase by giving them a better explanation of the product's features and functionality and allowing them to compare it to other products of a similar nature. Information on the product and suggestions for how the merchant could enhance their services are also given. Sentiment analysis, sometimes referred to as opinion mining, is a key activity of NLP (Natural Language Processing). It is a way to display feeling, thought, judgement, or expression and would be used to examine the feelings of the target audience towards an object. By analyzing the entire text to produce a classified sentiment, it detects both positive and negative opinions. Consumers today have far greater flexibility to voice their ideas and opinions, which can assist businesses in customizing their goods and services. Companies develop systems to assess consumer feedback and many interactions across various platforms in order to meet customer needs as a result of technology advancements in the fields of automation and machine learning.

## Data Source
The dataset has been collected from https://data.world/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products website and is a .csv file with the size of 365.82 MB. This is a list of over 1,500 consumer reviews for Amazon products like the Kindle, Fire TV Stick, and more provided by Datafiniti's Product Database. The dataset includes basic product information, rating, review text, and more for each product.

## Sentiment analysis 

Sentiment analysis is incredibly helpful for social media monitoring since it gives us a broad picture of how the general population feels about particular issues.

## Why Amazon Reviews are Important?
Simply said, an Amazon product review is a reflection of what the customer thinks about that particular item. You can learn about consumer demand and interests by analyzing product reviews. Additionally, it would give you marketing intelligence about the kinds of goods that customers are more likely to buy. They will be better equipped to comprehend their own product and the potential problems with it thanks to this insightful information.

## Goal for this Porject
This project aims to demonstrate how Python can be used to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon Customer Electronic Products Reviews. We are attempting to determine whether each textual review corresponds to a positive review (the consumer is satisfied) or a negative review (the customer is not satisfied). The reviewers' overall scores might be between 1 and 5.

## Tasks

1. Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization are all included in the first section, "Preparing Data".
2. Proposing Methods & Experiments - Using Logistic Regression and Linear Support Vector Machine Algorithms, use outcomes of the prediction accuracies of four distinct feature extraction models (Bag of Words, TF IDF, Word Embeddings, and Topic Modeling) used in Text-Classification (NLP).
